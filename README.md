# Compiler Issues

## If your are getting a utf-8 error when compiling you can do two things to fix it.
## The second option will fix this for all projects.

1) add /utf-8 in the additional options section of the projects property page under C/C++ CommandLine.

2) Enable Beta: Use UTF-8 for worldwide language support in Windows under Settings->Time & Language->Language->Administrative language settings-> Change system locale...

## When building for the first time you will need to run the build twice as some folder are not genertated and will cause a build error.
